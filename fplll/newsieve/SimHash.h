  This file defines "general" aspect of SimHashes (i.e. bit-vectors that are used as a "hash" of a
  point to approximately tell whether a vector is a good candiate for a reduction)

  - This file specifies the CoordinateSelection concept, which encapsulates the (usually randomized)
    *parameters* of the concrete SimHash in use.

  - This file defines the GlobalBitApproxData template, which holds the actual (global, static)
    parameters we are using. Note that those parameters (should) act essentially as a Singleton.

  - This file defines some functions to operate on SimHashes.

  Notably, such a SimHash can be applied to a lattice point p, resulting in a sequence of bits H(p).
  For 2 lattice points p, q on the sphere (Note that H is invariant under scaling), we have that
  the number of coinciding bits of their hashes is a rough measure for their distance, i.e.
  H(p) XOR H(q) is correlated with the (angular) distance between p,q.
  We use that to determine whether points are promising candidates for a reduction.

  Note: The difference between this usage (SimHash) and locality sensitive hashing / filtering
        techniques is that for the latter, we would organize our storage according to the value of
        the sim_hash, in order to directly obtain all points with a given (set of restrictions on
        the) sim_hash without looking at other points. This requires more elaborate data structure
        with a larger overhead. By constrast, for SimHashes we store the hashes along the points
        and *test* each candidate.

/**
  CONCEPT: CoordinateSelection

  For our use of SimHashes, we need to define a class that collects the (usually randomized)
  parameters of the hash functions(s).

  Such a class CoordinateSelection is called a Coordinate Selection (CooSelection).
  For a typical SimHash, we choose #output_bits many directions v_i and set the i-th bit of H(i) as
  the sign of <v_i, p>. The parameters of the hash functions then correspond to a selection of v_i's
  This is why we chose that name.
  Note that a given class that satisfies this concept might choose the v_i's in a structured, maybe
  implicit, way and does not need to store such v_i's explicitly (in fact, our choices don't).

  A CoordinateSelection is a class (concept) that has the following interface:
  - It has a public member typedef IsCooSelection = std::true_type
    (Check with IsACoordinateSelection<T>)
  - It has public member typedefs SimHashBlock and SimHashes
    SimHashBlock needs to be a std::bitset<block_len> or compatible,
    SimHashes    needs to be a random access container of SimHashBlocks
    (Note: "or compatible" means we might support e.g. boost/dynamic_bitset.
           random access container means access via sim_hash[index],
           e.g. a std::array, std::vector or C-style array of SimHashBlocks.)

    Note: We usually process a given SimHash block by block (in particular, when using a SimHash to
          detect whether a lattice vector is promising, we may want to terminate early and not even
          look at all bits of the SimHash to save time. This is why we consider a block structure,
          where the block_len is to be optimized for the target architecture, typically 64 bits.
  - public member functions get_sim_hash_len(), get_sim_hash_num() that return the number of bits
    per block (len) respectively the number of blocks (num).
    (Note: These are typically constexpr static.)
  - It has a public member typedef DimensionType,
    which is Default-constructible, copy-assignable and convertible to / from integral types.
  - CoordinateSelection is default-constructible and copy-assignable.
    (Note: it need not be usable after default-construction, this requirement is purely syntactic)
  - It has constructors CoordinateSelection(DimensionType const dim, unsigned int seed)
                    and CoordinateSelection(DimensionType const dim)
    If seed it set, all functions (including those constructors) should be deterministic.
    (Note: DimensionType typically is either some MaybeFixed<nfixed> or some unsigned integer)
  - it has a public member template function
    SimHashes compute_all_bitapproximations(LatticePoint const &p) const
    After a CoordinateSelection object was created by one of the two mentioned constructors above,
    this deterministically computes all sim_hashes of the point p. LatticePoint may be any lattice
    point class (see LatticePointConcept.h for what is a "LatticePoint" in this context).

/**
  Usage inside the GaussSieve:

  GlobalBitApproxData<CoordinateSelection> holds a static object of type CoordinateSelection.

  The SieveTraits class that is passed as a parameter to most modules of the GaussSieve selects a
  concrete CoordinateSelection class that is used. Classes then can use
  GlobalBitApproxData<concrete CoordinateSelection>::coo_selection to access the global static.
  This global static is initialized using the CoordinateSelection(dim, seed) - constructor by
  the main sieve.

  An object of type StaticInitializer<GlobalBitApproxData<CoordinateSelection>> defined below is
  used for this. Note that this ensure that you do not (re-)initialize CoordinateSelection with
  different paramters as long as the old StaticInitializer<GlobalBitApproxData<CoordinateSelection>>
  is alive. In particular, to change the coordinate selection, you have to destroy all objects of
  the GaussSieve class beforehand.
  (See GlobalStaticData.h for details on StaticInitializer's)

  LHS / RHS may be either a SimHash or something having an access_bitapproximation function

  Cumulative means the following:

  We first check lhs[0] XOR rhs[0] against ub[0], lb[0].
  On the next level, we check (lhs[0] XOR rhs[0]) + (lhs[1] XOR rhs[1]) against ub[1] and lb[1] etc.

  Note: a "scalar product" corresponds rougly to 1 - 2*(lhs XOR rhs)/len, in the sense that
        for points on the unit sphere, the expression 1-2*(lhs XOR rhs)/len is close to 1 if the
        points are close, close to -1 if the points are near-antipodes and close to 0 if the points
        are near-orthogonal.
        In particular, lhs XOR rhs itself becomes *smaller* if the scalar product gets *larger*, so
        the lower thresholds on the XOR means an upper threshold on the scalar product.
