/*
ExactLatticePoint<ET,nfixed> stores an (exact) lattice point, together with its (squared) length.
nfixed denotes a fixed dimension (at compile-time) of vectors, with -1 meaning runtime-determined.
nfixed is not currently implemented.
*/

template <class ET,int nfixed=-1> class ExactLatticePoint;

/*
Usage notes:
    While ExactLatticePoint is currently implemented as derived from NumVect, usage of NumVect - specific classes is not recommended, as this might be changed.
    (NumVect's design clashes with the style used throughout the sieving code)
    Warning: Usage of NumVect - functions does not update norm2 appropriately.

    ExactLatticePoints may be copied, moved and default-constructed.
    Use ExactLatticePoint(dim,fill) to create a vector of dimension dim, filled with fill.

public members:
    ET norm2:                   square of norm. Use read-only.

public member functions defined:

    normalize()                 Updates norm2, usually no need to call directly.
    access_vector()             Used to access the underlying NumVect, READ-ONLY
    access_norm2()              Used to access norm2, READ-ONLY.  point.norm2 is equivalent to point.access_norm2(),  except that it enforces const-ness is and provided for consistency.
    get_dim()                   Used to retrieve the dimension of the vector. May become deprecated.
    print_exact_point(os=cout)  Prints to the output stream os, default is cout. Output includes norm^2.

Important operators supported:
    [i]                         Access i'th coordinate (via NumVect). Accessing out-of-range may cause undefined behaviour.
    =                           Copies / moves
    <, <=, >, >=                Compares by length. Note that these comparison operators only satisfy very weak guarantees. In particular, A <= B, B<=A does not imply A==B.
    stream <<, stream >>        Stream input/output. Input is not implemented yet.
    +, - (binary/unary)         Arithmetic

Non-member functions:
    void scalar_mult (A, x)     A := A*x where A is an ExactLatticePoint and x is an ET - scalar. Overwrites A.
    ET exact_scalar_product(A,B)Returns the scalar product of A and B.

    TODO: Cleanup conversion from matrix_row, more arithmetic, don't inherit from NumVect

/*

/*
    ApproximateLatticePoint stores an approximation to a lattice point in the form
    2^exponent * (mantissa), where exponent is shared among coordinates and
    (mantissa) is a vector of type LatticeApproximations::ApproxType (should be approx 16-32 bits)
    We also store a copy of the norm^2 of the mantissa (so the real norm is 2^2exponent * norm_of_mantissa
    Note that is does not really depend much on the underlying type ET, which is only used to select the correct conversion routines and to know whether the exponent may be negative.
*/

template<class ET, int nfixed=-1> class ApproximateLatticePoint;      //This class represents a stand-alone approximation to a lattice point

/*
Usage notes:
    ApproximateLatticePoint is essentially a wrapper around some vector of int's (called mantissas) and an exponent
    Since the lattice points we use in our algorithm(s) have all the same dimension, we do not explicitly store the dimension for each such vector.
    A consequence is that copy - routines need to be explicitly supplied with the dimension. In particular, we have NO copy constructor.
    Note that even if we would store the dimension, we would opt to have no copy constructor, since we want to force the user to explicitly express intent to copy (by design).

    ApproximateLatticePoints may be moved and default-constructed. The is no real copy constructor.
    There is a "copy" constructor ApproximateLatticePoint(old, dim) taking dimension as argument.
    explicit ApproximateLatticePoint(exact_point) creates an approximation from an exact point.
    TODO: Construct from Compressed & Shadow

public member functions defined:
    get_norm2_mantissa()            gets the mantissa of the squared norm.
    get_norm2_exponent()            gets the exponent of the squared norm. Squared norm = 2^get_norm2_exponent * get_norm2_mantissa
    access_vectors_mantissa()       used to access the actual vector. Avoid using it, as return value type (currently pointer) might change. Might become private.
    get_vectors_exponent()          gets the exponent of the vector. The actual approx is 2^get_vectors_exponent * vectors_mantissa. Might become private.
    replace_by(other,dim)           A.replace_by(B,dim) causes A:=B.
    AppLatPo make_copy(dim)         creates a copy.  A = B.make_copy(dim) causes A:=B.
    get_norm2_double()              returns norm2 as a double.

non-member functions:
    create_detached_approximation(exact_point) creates an approximation from an exact point. Same as constructor, really.

    To compute scalar products, there is
    GaussSieve::compute_mantissa_sc_product(A,B,dim) to compute <A,B>   for ApproximateLatticePoints A,B
    GaussSieve::compute_vec_sc_product(A,B,dim)                         for the underlying vectors (don't use if you can avoid it!)
    approximate_scalar_product_d(A,B,dim)       this one returns a double.

TODO:   Arithmetic, convert to vectors of doubles?
NOTE:   See utility.h for algorithms that compute&compare scalar products (without converting to double)
        We do not have a class for mantissa + exponent, because we can just use IEEE floats. doubles have enough precision.

/*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CompressedPoint
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*/

//This class represents an approximate point together with some extra data (called Details) that allows to recover the exact point again.
//Note that access to the exact point may be slow (in multi-threading, it might involve locks or fences), so working with the approximation is prefered.

template<class ET, bool MT, int nfixed=-1> class CompressedPoint;
/*
Usage notes:
    CompressedPoints are what are stored in the main list. The main queue also returns these.
    (Note: THe main queue might always use MT==false)
    A compressed point is a lattice point in a "compressed" format that allows quick access to the approximation and possibly slow access to the exact point.
    CompressedPoints have NO copy constructor, because there are cases where we need deep and where we need shallow copies.

    CompressedPoints may be moved and default-constructed, but not directly copied/copy-assigned.
    CompressedPoints may be created from ExactLatticePoints or pointers to exact lattice points:
    explicit CompressedPoint(exact_lattice_point)
    explicit CompressedPoint(*exact_lattice_point)
    Important: The latter transfers ownership, whereas the first does not!

public member functions:
    access_approximation_r()            accesses the approximation.
    get_approximation_const_ptr()       returns const pointer to approximation
    get_approximation_ptr               returns point to appoximation
    access_exact_point_r()              accesses the exact point -- DO NOT USE THIS IN MULTI-THREADED, will be made non-public

    get_approx_norm2_mantissa()         returns a copy of the approximate norm's mantissa
    get_approx_norm2_exponent()         returns a copy of the approximate norm's exponent
    get_approx_norm2_d()                returns a copy of the approximate norm as a double
    get_approx_vectors_exponent()       returns a copy of the exponent of the approximate vector.
    access_approx_vectors_mantissa      allows access to the underlying mantissa of the vector. Avoid using

    get_exact_norm2                     gets a copy of the exact norm (of type ET)
    get_exact_point                     returns a copy of the exact point (of type ExactLatticePoint)
    deep_copy_compressed_point          returns a copy of the compressed point (expensive, since it copies the underlying details)

    is_zero()                           tells whether a point is zero. Looks at the approximation only.

NOTE:
    We have a shallow copy version to another type rather than just doing ref-counting.
    The latter would be much easier, but has the problem that updating the ref-counts requires thread-synchronisation.
    Also, we do not really want to restrict the nature of "details" too much, these could be some kind of globally managed object.
