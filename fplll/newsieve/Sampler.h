/**
 This file provided the interface for the lattice point sampler.
 To this end, this file provides a virtual interface template class Sampler, from which the actual
 samplers are derived. We use dynamic (runtime) polymorphism for the sampler.

 Having such a virtual interface class allows us to take a user-provided sampler whose internal
 workings we do not anticipate. The main sieve class (or rather the queue stored inside) contains
 a pointer to a Sampler object (or rather a type derived from Sampler)
 The overhead of virtual dispatch is negligible for sampling.
 (Sampling does not dominate the running time and even if we use a slow sampler, the dispatch cost
 will matter even less)

 Dependencies:
 The sampler instance contains a pointer back to the sieve main object, creating circular
 dependencies (This is done to give user-provided samplers access to the sieve's data).
 For this reason, parts of the implementation are in Sampler_impl.h, which is included *after* all
 *.h files in SieveGauss_main.h

 The associating with a GaussSieve object is performed by an init() function _after_ construction
 of the actual sieve object. The reason is that the lifetime of a (user-provided) sampler will be
 a superset of the lifetime of the GaussSieve object.

/**
This class is a generic Sampler. It serves as interface and all other sampler are derived from it.

Sseq is supposed to satisfy the C++ concept "SeedSequence". The standard library has std::seed_seq
as a canonical example.
Engine is supposed to satisfy the C++ concept of a "Random Number Engine". <random> provides several
of those, e.g. std::mt19937_64.
(These are selected as default template arguments)

Note that the Sampler parent class manages the randomness source.

IMPORTANT:  The main sieve can take a user-provided sampler, which may be of any possibly
            user-defined class derived from Sampler.
            This user-defined sampler object will be constructed *before* the sieve and may outlive
            the sieve. For that reason, some initializations are defered from the constructor to
            init() / custom_init, which get called after the sampler is associated with the sieve.
            If the macro DEBUG_SIEVE_STANDALONE_SAMPLER is set, we may even use the sampler without
            any associated sieve. (This latter case need not work with user-defined samplers)
