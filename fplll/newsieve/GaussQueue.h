/**
  This file defines a class for the queue that stores the yet-unprocessed points of the Sieve.
  It essentially wraps around a std::(priority?) queue, with the added feature that
  whenever the queue is empty, we call the sampler to get a fresh point.

  Note that for compatibility with multi-threading, we provide a function true_pop that obtains the
  next element and removes it from the queue in a single operation (for std::queue, these are
  separate operations, but for multi-threaded data structures, it is better to combine these)

  TODO: Currently, we use an (unsorted) queue if USE_REGULAR_QUEUE is set, a (sorted) priority queue
        otherwise (in the single-threaded case). The unsorted queue is faster overall.

  NOTE: The Queue's constructor takes a pointer to the caller sieve, in order to access some of its
        data (notably, it needs to forward that pointer to the sampler, which might be
        user-provided, so we do not know which data the sampler needs)
        For unit testing, there is the debug symbol DEBUG_SIEVE_STANDALONE_QUEUE that allows
        (forces, actually) to use nullptr for that pointer. It deactivates some features, naturally.

#ifndef USE_REGULAR_QUEUE
  // If this symbol is not set, we use a priority queue to always process the smallest element from
  // the queue.
  // However, there is the issue that std::priortiy_queue does not allow non-const access to its
  // elements (presumably, because modifying would destroy the sorting)
  // This is true even if we erase that element immediately afterwards.

  // In particular, we can not use move semantics to get the next element, which is bad because
  // lattice points are not copyable. (This is a known issue with std::priority_queue)
  // As a solution, we store pointers to lattice points in the priority queue (which we can copy)
  // (Alternatively, use const_cast; while it is extremely likely to work, this depends on the
  // implementation details of priority_queue and might be UB. Also, we would need to overwrite
  // norm2 in the point to its old value, because the pop() operation (i.e. delete the top
  // element) of priority_queue might perform comparisons with the to-be-deleted element to update
  // its data structure, depending on the data structure it keeps)
