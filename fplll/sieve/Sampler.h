//The class MTPRNG is just a wrapper around a PRNG engine to facilitate switching to multi-threaded.

//a vector of Engines, whereas, MTPRNG<Engine,false,.> is a wrapper around Engine.
//reseed seeds *all* engines. Use rnd(thread-id) to obtain the underlying Engine.
//Thread-safety: Init and reseed are not thread-safe. Concurrent calls to rnd are fine.
//You may concurrently call rnd and use init to increase (but not decrease) the number of threads.

//Randomness path:
//The global (master) seed that is input to the constructor resp. to reseed is used to create 20x32 bit per-thread-seeds for each actual Engine.
//The output from theses engine(s) is then accessed using rnd(thread-number).
//This is done even in the single-threaded case to ensure consistency.
//Note that for obtaining the per-thread seeds from the master seeds, we use a fixed Mersenne twister engine and not the engine given as template parameter.
